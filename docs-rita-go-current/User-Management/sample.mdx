<!-- SECTION 2: PAGE CONTENT -->
<!-- This is the actual documentation content users (and the LLM) read. Keep it short, one topic per page. This is just a sample!  -->

# Accessing the Login Page

## What You Need to Log In

Before accessing the system, ensure you have the following:

- Valid username or email address
- Current password
- Active account status
- Compatible web browser

<!--
Tip:
Use clear headers and lists.
Each section should answer a single user question (e.g., "How do I log in?").
Avoid multiple topics in one file.
-->

<!-- SECTION 3: VIDEO EMBED EXAMPLE -->
<!-- Use this to embed a product video or tutorial related to this topic. -->
<!-- The component pulls a thumbnail and video link from your custom Docusaurus setup. -->
<!-- WE WILL GO OVER THIS USAGE ONCE WE ACTUALLY HAVE VIDEOS. -->

## THE TITLE OF THE VIDEO GOES HERE

import FeaturedVideoComponent from '../src/components/Video/FeaturedVideo'

<FeaturedVideoComponent
  title='ADD TITLE HERE OR LEAVE IT BLANK'
  thumbnailFileName='docusaurus.png'
  videoUrl='https://training.resolve.io/learning/video-gallery/videos/?video=pro-featured-video'
/>

<!--
How this works:
- `title` shows above the embedded video (optional)
- `thumbnailFileName` points to the image in your `/static/img` or similar folder
- `videoUrl` links to your hosted video
-->
