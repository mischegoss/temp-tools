# Setting Up Your Knowledge Base with Rita Go

## What You Need to Get Started

Before creating your knowledge base, ensure you have the following:

- Important documents (PDFs, support tickets, procedures, articles)
- Valid RitaGo account with upload permissions
- Compatible web browser
- Organized file structure for efficient uploading

## Document Upload Process

RitaGo's upload wizard makes it simple to add your documents without any coding required. Simply gather your important files and use the intuitive interface to upload them to the system.

## How Document Processing Works

Behind the scenes, RitaGo transforms your uploaded documents through a sophisticated process:

### Text Chunking

Each document gets broken down into smaller, digestible chunks of text that are easier for the system to process and search.

### Vectorization

These text chunks are converted into mathematical vectors - strings of numbers that capture the meaning and context of your content, allowing computers to understand and compare information.

### Database Storage

The chunks and their vectors are stored together in a specialized vector database, creating a unified knowledge base from all your uploaded documents with built-in access controls for security.

## Benefits of Centralized Knowledge

Having a central knowledge base ensures that when anyone in your organization asks a question, answers are drawn from the same trusted information source - directly from your documents. This process, called grounding, helps prevent AI hallucinations where systems make up incorrect information.

## Advanced Search Capabilities

RitaGo goes beyond traditional keyword search through semantic matching and language processing. When you ask a question, the system converts it into a vector and matches it against the database, finding results based on meaning and context rather than just exact word matches.

## The Result

With RitaGo, you get accurate answers backed by your own documents that are always available, always consistent, and always grounded in your organization's knowledge. This ensures reliable information delivery while maintaining data security and privacy.
