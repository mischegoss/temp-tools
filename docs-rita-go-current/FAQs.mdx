### Rita-Go Chatbot FAQs

(REPLACE THIS IS MADE UP!)

#### 1. How do I start a conversation with the chatbot?

Simply click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner of your screen and type your question or request. The chatbot will automatically detect your intent and guide you to the right information or workflow.

#### 2. What kinds of questions can the chatbot answer?

Rita-Go can assist with product setup, troubleshooting, workflow automation, and activity guidance. It can also provide links to relevant documentation pages, videos, or guided steps.

#### 3. How is Rita-Go different from other chatbots?

Rita-Go is integrated directly with Resolve’s knowledge base and automation engine. That means it doesn’t just _answer_ questions—it can trigger workflows, display analytics, and help you take real actions inside Resolve.

#### 4. Can the chatbot handle multiple topics in one conversation?

Yes, Rita-Go supports contextual awareness. It can follow your conversation flow across multiple topics, such as setup, activity errors, and dashboard analytics, without losing track of previous messages.

#### 5. What should I do if the chatbot gives the wrong answer?

If Rita-Go provides an incorrect or incomplete response, you can type **“feedback”** or click the feedback option in the chat window. This helps our team improve its accuracy and understanding over time.

#### 6. Is my data secure when I interact with Rita-Go?

Absolutely. All chatbot interactions are encrypted, and no personal or confidential data is stored without your explicit consent. Rita-Go follows the same enterprise-grade security policies as the Resolve platform.
