        <h1>Azure AD Users Synchronization</h1>

        <h2>Activity Description</h2>
        <p>Synchronizes Azure AD users/groups and their data with the VAR::PRODUCT_FULL recipients list. The activity imports Groups' and Users' information from Azure AD into Actions.</p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>Success / Failure.</p>

        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Username</strong> – Username of an administrator account that will be accessing the Azure portal to sync users into</li>
          <li><strong>Password</strong> – The password associated with the account used above.</li>
          <li><strong>App Client ID</strong> – The App Client ID associated with the Azure AD where the users reside.</li>
          <li><strong>AD Users</strong> – The list of AD users/groups to synchronize. This can be static (the object ID for a single user and/or group) or a reference to a memory table created for this purpose.<br/>Example: <code>%AzureID%</code></li>
          <li><strong>Update Existing</strong> – By default, if a user or a group already exists in Actions (created manually before synchronization), they will not be updated. When this is checked, existing users are updated.</li>
          <li><strong>Recursive Groups</strong> – When a group is synchronized you may decide whether to synchronize the data recursively or not. When synchronizing the data recursively, sub-groups and user data are also synchronized.</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <strong>Note:</strong> The fields that will be synced from Azure AD to Resolve Actions are: Username, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Mobile Phone.<br/><br/>
          Username, First Name, and Last Name are required. Email and Mobile Phone are highly recommended to contact recipients once they've been synced into Resolve Actions.
